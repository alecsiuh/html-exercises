                Rise in carbon capture as global warming speeds growth of forests would be negated by earlier deaths, say scientists

                Live fast, die young is a truism often applied to rock stars but could just as easily describe trees,
                according to new research.
                Trees that grow rapidly have a shorter lifespan, which could spell bad news for tackling the climate crisis.

                Trees grow faster in warmer conditions,
                and this should act as a natural brake on global heating,
                as they take up and store more carbon dioxide from the air as they grow.
                But a new study casts doubt on this beneficial cycle, finding that the faster trees grow, the sooner they die â€“ and therefore stop storing carbon.
