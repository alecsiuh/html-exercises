    <h1>Nexus 5</h1>
    <p>
        The Nexus 5 (2015) will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 29 according to a report from <strong> CNET. CNET </strong> does not provide <br>
        a source for this information, but recent, unrelated speculation also suggested this date. <strong>CNET</strong> also adds weight to the rumors <br>
        that two devices will be revealed at this launch; the smaller Nexus made by LG and the larger version by Huawei.
    </p>

    <p>This news might have inadvertently revealed the release date for <strong>Android Marshmallow</strong>  too. Google usually drops its latest Nexus devices at the same time as the latest <br>
        version of Android, as it did last year with the Nexus 6 and Android 5.0 Lollipop. <br>
        Will we see this trend continue in 2015? It won't be long until we find out.
